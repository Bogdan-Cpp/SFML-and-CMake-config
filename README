First, go on `CMakeLists.txt`

1. for `include_directories("C:/Users/leita/Documents/SFML/SFML-3.0.0/include")` change the path by searching for 'include' folder in SFML folder.
   
    -`C:/Users/your_name/your_location/SFML/SFML-3.0.0/include` (<span style="color:red;">just an example</span>)


2. for `C:/Users/leita/Documents/SFML/SFML-3.0.0/lib` it's the same, just search for 'lib' folder on SFML folder.

3. for `set(SFML_DIR "C:/Users/leita/Documents/SFML/SFML-3.0.0/lib/cmake/SFML")` you need to navigate `SFML->SFML3.0.0->lib->cmake->sfml` and copy the location and change it.

4. Now you can build the project
